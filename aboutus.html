        <p class="description">
          Hello - I'm Rosh ðŸ‘‹ - a local of Blackheath for almost 4 years now.
          Having owned a fair few cars, I've always enjoyed taking them to
          meet-ups when possible. However, although [we] all love driving, its
          normally a bit of schlep to get to the other car meets around London
          and beyond.

          <br /><br />Our mission is simple - to establish a car community in the heart
          of Blackheath. My neck has sharply swivelled more than a few times by
          some of the great cars Ive seen in the area. We definitely have an
          untapped opportunity here!

          <br />
          <br />
          So, with a coffee in hand, and probably some cake - feel free to
          <a class="link-style" href="index.html">sign up</a> to the waitlist as
          we look to host a meet-up this fall near the village. Thank for taking the time to visit the webiste. Lastly, if you
          see me around the heath - feel free to say hi!

          <br /><br />Reg: P1AHX
