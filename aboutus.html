          Hello - I'm Rosh. I've been in Blackheath for almost 4 years now.
          Having owned a fair few cars, I've always enjoyed taking them to
          meet-ups when possible. However, although [we] all love driving, its
          normally a bit of schlep to get to the other car meets around London
          and beyond.
          
          <br/><br/>The mission is to establish a car community in the heart of Blackheath. My neck has sharply swivelled more than a few times by
          some of the great cars Ive seen in the area. We definitely have an untapped opportunity here. 
          
          <br/> <br/>
          So, with a coffee in hand, and probably some cake - feel free to <a class="link-style" href="index.html">sign up</a> to the waitlist as we
          look to host a meet-up this fall near the village. Lastly, if you see
          me around the heath - feel free to say hi! 
          
          <br/><br/>Reg: P1AHX
